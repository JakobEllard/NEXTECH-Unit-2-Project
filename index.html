                Our planet is a flat disc ringed by an ice wall.
                <br>
                NASA photoshops its satellite images, based on observations that the color of the oceans changes from image to image and that continents seem to be in different places. The publicly perpetuated image is kept up through a large-scale practice of “compartmentalization”, according to which only a select number of individuals have knowledge about the real truth.
                <br>
                NASA and other government agencies conspire to delude the public into believing the Earth is spherical. According to the most widely spread version of current flat Earth theory, NASA is guarding the Antarctic ice wall that surrounds Earth.

                <h2>Plan of Action</h2>
                <!--Add text, images, and links for section 3 below!-->
                We can test this theory by smashing a hole in the ice wall, then draining the ocean and allowing all the water to fall off the side.
                <br>
                This will doom the earth to dehydration, but sacrifices must be made in search of the truth
